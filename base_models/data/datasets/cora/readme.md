I used the same data used in the paper: The cora dataset. The data is a network of machine learning papers, classified into seven categories. 

Genetic_Algorithms
Neural_Networks
Probabilistic_Methods
Reinforcement_Learning
Rule_Learning
Theory

Please refer to the documentation of the dataset [here](https://github.com/tkipf/pygcn/blob/master/data/cora/README)
